## Description

Based on BrowserCreds from illwill, this version grabs Facebook session cookies from Chrome on Windows, decrypt them and put them in /root/udisk/loot/FacebookSession    
Only works for Chrome on Windows. Tested on two different Windows 10 machines.    
Only payload.txt is required, powershell script is here only if you want to modify it.
